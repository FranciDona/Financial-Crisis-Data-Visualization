# Financial_Crisis_Data_Viz_US_IT
A data visualization notebook looking at stock prices of some major banks in the US and Italy during the financial crisis.

Using pandas datareader I extracted data on stock prices, and then tested a few visualization functions from different libraries:
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Plotly
